        <p> Donkey Kong is an arcade game that was Nintendo's first big hit in North America. It marked the beginning of the Mario franchise, and introduced several of the earliest characters, including Mario himself (originally known as "Jumpman", a carpenter rather than a plumber), the original Donkey Kong (who, in later games, would become Cranky Kong, the current Donkey Kong's grandfather), and Pauline (originally known as the Lady), who now frequently appears in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series. <br> <br> SOURCE: https://www.mariowiki.com/Donkey_Kong_(game)

        <p> Super Mario Bros. is a video game released for the Family Computer and Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. It shifted the gameplay away from its single-screen arcade predecessor, Mario Bros., and instead featured side-scrolling platformer levels. While not the first game of the Mario franchise, Super Mario Bros. is the most iconic, and introduced various series staples, from power-ups, to classic enemies like Goombas, to the basic premise of rescuing Princess Toadstool from King Koopa. <br> <br> SOURCE: https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Bros.

        <p> Super Mario 64 is a 3D action-adventure platformer game that still lives with the title as the best selling Nintendo 64 game of all time. Being the first 3D Mario game, Super Mario 64 has introduced many moves that would be used in almost every later Super Mario title: Triple Jumping, Ground Pounding, Long Jumping, Diving, and Somersaults. Punching and kicking were also introduced, but would not be used in any later main title (besides its DS remake). <br> <br> SOURCE: https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_64

        <p>  Super Smash Bros. Melee is the second installment in the Super Smash Bros. series and is the follow-up to Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64. Various characters from Nintendo's popular franchises battle on different stages, also taken from the Nintendo franchises. Many major characters of the Mario franchise make an appearance. The game's major focus is the capability to both build and destroy relationships in multiplayer mode, while still offering a number of single-player modes for when you have lost all of your friends. <br> <br> SOURCE: https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee
